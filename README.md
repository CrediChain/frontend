## Introduction
CrediChain is an innovative platform designed to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for verifying educational credentials and certifications. Our frontend application caters to both educational institutions and students, aiming to streamline the verification process and enhance trust in academic achievements.

## Problem Statement
### Educational Credentials and Certification
1. **Credential Fraud**: The prevalence of fake degrees and certificates undermines the credibility of educational institutions, creating significant challenges for employers and students alike.
2. **Verification Delays**: Employers and educational institutions often face significant delays in verifying the authenticity of educational credentials, leading to inefficiencies in hiring and admissions processes.

## Inspiration
The idea for CrediChain was inspired by SheerID, a platform that focuses on identity verification to provide solutions across various industries. By leveraging blockchain technology, CrediChain aims to establish a similar trust mechanism specifically for educational credentials. Learn more about SheerID [here](https://www.sheerid.com/).
